Art



Edit
Caleb Chisom Scholarship

Caleb was an avid reader and a diligent student in all of his homeschool subjects. Growing up in a rural community in Virginia, he developed a great love for the outdoors and for all the activities that a boy his age could enjoy.

However, there was one subject and activity that Caleb enjoyed above all others–drawing. Even at the age of 3, Caleb would sit quietly for hours, pencil in hand, drawing pictures. The dominant request at his birthday was always for more art supplies.

Having accepted the Lord as his personal Savior at the age of 7, Caleb grew in his love for Christ. His primary goal was to attend Bob Jones University to receive a degree in art. At age 13, Caleb formulated a plan to earn the funds for college; he certainly was not afraid of hard work to achieve a special goal.

However, the Lord had some different plans for Caleb, and through it all He showed Himself faithful. In 2001, at the age of 9, Caleb was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumor. Following surgery and treatments, he recovered and resumed his enthusiasm for learning and for art. Then in 2005 he was diagnosed with a second brain tumor that was inoperable. On July 18, 2006, at age 14, Caleb went home to be with his Lord and Savior.
